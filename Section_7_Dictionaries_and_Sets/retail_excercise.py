# For this exercise, imagine you're working on a retail website.
#
# Customers can favourite certain items that they're interested in.
#
# They can also purchase items, by adding them to their shopping basket – or cart.
#
# As they browse the various items for sale, the web page will display a list of items that they might be interested
# in purchasing. That list will be the items they've marked as "favourites'.
#
# But we don't want to suggest items that the customer has already added to their shopping basket.
#
# The code to create the favourites and basket sets has already been written and tested.
#
#
# Your task is to create a sorted list of the customer's favourite items, without any items that are in their basket.
